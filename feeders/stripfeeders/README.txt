An OpenSCAD file for producing a parameterized bank of strip feeders.

These are designed so with standard magnetic tape they will adhere to
the bed, a pinhole is provided to insert a holder, and you can use the
peeler design to hand-peel and feed the strip without worrying about
bouncing the parts.
