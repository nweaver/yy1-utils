These are dimensional figures taken from a measured YY1 feeder.

Feeder:

Total length: 138mm
Width/feeder: 12mm for 8mm tape
Exit curve: 80 degrees
Exit opening: 14mm
Exit width: 9mm for 8mm tape (so +.5mm/side
Base of tape: 21.5mm
Total height: 24.5mm
Pick start: 45mm
Pick length: 25mm (could reduce)



Tape:
Hole Diameter: 1.5mm
Hole from edge: 1.75mm
Hole Pitch: 4mm
Tape thickness: 1.6mm max
25mm radius min curve.

Pocket from non-sprocket side: min space .6mm

Max thickness w pocket: 2.5 (for 8mm) 6.5 (for 12mm), 8.0 (for 16mm),
12.0 (for 20mm).

Do the tension mechanism on the TOP rather than underneeth: it will
make it stick up a little, but it becomes easy to release the
sprocket, it doesn't affect the component height, etc.  The tape will
go over but as its rotating with the tape direction it shouldn't cause
issues.
