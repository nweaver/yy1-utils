This is a design for an improved drag-feeder arrangement for the YY1.

It is designed to be printed in three pieces: the non-sprocket side,
the sprocket side, and the gear wheel.

Of note, there is a substantially different holding mechanism for
dealing with the peeling: Instead of a tension bar (which can have
variable tension depending on the strip), it uses a toothed gear on a
694-ZZ bearing (4mm long, 11mm OD, 4mm ID) with a ratchet mechanism on
the gear.

This should hopefully provide even resistance regardless of the tape
type (the YY1 in particular is not good with plastic tape because of
the sliding forces.)

It also has a track for the drag needle to prevent tape "bouncing", as
the needle can only decend

It is also designed to hold a set of magnets (5mm x 2mm) to anchor the
feeder to the bed, and a key to have the feeder slot into a mounting
bracket using the existing mounting holes.  This is to enable faster
changing of the feeders while keeping the positioning consistent.

This is designed to be printed in esd-PETG, with a .1mm or smaller
layer height.
