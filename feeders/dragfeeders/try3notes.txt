Changes need to be made still:

Base plate should be grooved rather than holed, and needs an end-plate
to force alignment of the left-most feeder.  End plate should be full
length.

End needs to be pure vertical at end of current length to feed into
discard chute.

May want to clamp weight onto tape to better feed and/or see if you
can adjust the pull duration.



Need to improve:

a) Direct mount into mounting plate, rather than magnets.

b) Keep the slightly wider pinhole on the no-gear version, adjust the
pick opening to have a chamfer so it can print clean.

c) Have a chamfer starting at .4mm and growing down the drag area to
get better/cleaner tape pulling.  Something that will be 1 width for
the peel point, and fan out to 2/3/4...

d) Chamfer for screw clearance needs to be a bit longer and 1mm
deeper...

e) Need cheap plastic tape & reel component for testing...

f) Mounting holes should be .2mm radius larger.

g) Move the spring in .2mm?

h) String together on 3mm diameter (1.5mm radius) steel rod, first one
anchored, rest strung on.

i) Shave .4mm off additional width for geared version.
