Changes need to be made still:

Base plate should be grooved rather than holed, and needs an end-plate
to force alignment of the left-most feeder.  End plate should be full
length.

End needs to be pure vertical at end of current length to feed into
discard chute.

May want to clamp weight onto tape to better feed and/or see if you
can adjust the pull duration.
